ARC-V Processors Overview
=========================

The Synopsys ARC-Vâ„¢ processors leverage the proven
microarchitecture of the existing ARC processor offerings, while
giving customers access to the expanding RISC-V ecosystem.
The Synopsys ARC-V portfolio, based on the RISC-V ISA, includes
high-performance, mid-range, and ultra-low power families, as well
as functional safety (FS) versions, to address a broad range of
application workloads.

New Generation of RISC-V Synopsys ARC Processors
------------------------------------------------

The ARC-V RMX-100 and RMX-500 Series
----------------------------------------

The 32-bit ARC-V RMX series includes the three-stage-pipeline RMX-100
and the five-stage-pipeline RMX-500 processors, which are optimized
for ultra-low power embedded applications. The processors offer
optional DSP support for greater signal processing efficiency. The
RMX processors offer ISO 26262 ASIL B and D functional-safety compliance as
well as ISO 21434 cybersecurity compliance.

The ARC-V RHX Series
--------------------

The 32-bit ARC-V RHX-100 series consists of superscalar,
single-core and multicore processors optimized for efficient
real-time applications. It includes support for coherent accelerators
and real-time hardware virtualization as well as optional RVV
extensions (RHX-100V/105V). For safety-critical applications, the
RHX-100 series offers functional-safety-compliant versions of all the
processors in the series.

ARC-V RPX Processors
--------------------

The 64-bit ARC-V RPX-100 series consists of multicore processors with 
64-bit RISC-V defined profile support for both user and supervisor 
modes. The multicore ARC-V RPX-105 supports SMP Linux and 
shared L3 cache. It offers configurations up to 16 cores and is 
optimized for efficient host processing performance for a variety 
of applications. The RPX-100 series also offers functional-safety-
compliant versions of its processors.

RISC-V Standard Conformance
---------------------------

ARC-V processors are based on the RISC-V ISA, and thanks to that allow use of a huge ecosystem of  available tools and software.
To be compatible with those tools and software requires compliance with base specifications such as the following:

* `The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume I: Unprivileged ISA, version 20191213 <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf>`_
* `The RISC-V Instruction Set Manual Volume II: Privileged Architecture, version 1.12 <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Priv-v1.12/riscv-privileged-20211203.pdf>`_
* `RISC-V psABI Specification, version 1.0 <https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-elf-psabi-doc/releases/download/v1.0/riscv-abi.pdf>`_
* `RISC-V Advanced Interrupt Architecture, version 1.0 <https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aia/releases/download/1.0/riscv-interrupts-1.0.pdf>`_
